### About Me

Iâ€™m a DevOps Engineer with over 4 years of experience, passionate about building secure, scalable, and reliable infrastructure in the cloud. I enjoy automating processes, designing CI/CD pipelines, and working with teams to deliver solutions that just work.

- I work daily with AWS and Azure, using tools like Terraform, ARM Templates, and Ansible for infrastructure.
- I build and manage CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, and GitLab CI/CD.
- My experience includes Docker, Kubernetes (EKS & AKS), Helm, and Argo CD for containerized deployments.
- Security and monitoring are top priorities: I use IAM, Security Groups, WAF, Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, and the ELK stack.
- I believe in collaboration, good documentation, and sharing what I learn.
